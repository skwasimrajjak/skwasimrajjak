Currently, I am a front-end developer. Soon to be a full-stack developer as I learn something new every day. Love coding and uploaded some basic websites (initially created by me) to track my improvement through out the process of learning. I have a rudimentary understanding of C and Python programming.Very enthusiastic about collaboration. Creating a team of like-minded people and working with them to build a project is something I often do and like to do so. Having a constant urge to learn made me do whatever I did to date.
