# Movie App

This repository contains an Android Movie App built using Java, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The app uses Retrofit to make network requests to The Movie Database (TMDB) REST API to fetch popular movies and display them in a RecyclerView.

## Features

- Fetches and displays popular movies from TMDB API.
- MVVM architecture for a clean separation of concerns.
- Retrofit for network requests.
- LiveData for observable data.
- RecyclerView for displaying movie list.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **model**
  - `Movie.java`: Defines the schema of the movie data, extends `BaseObservable` for data binding, and includes methods for loading movie poster images.
  - `MovieRepository.java`: Abstracts data source details and provides a central source of movie data using Retrofit.
  - `Results.java`: Defines the schema for API results, similar to the movie schema.
- serviceapi
  - `MovieApiService.java`: Defines the API endpoints using Retrofit annotations.
  - `RetrofitInstance.java`: Sets up Retrofit and provides an instance for accessing the API.
- **view**
  - `MovieAdapter.java`: Manages the RecyclerView, binds data to views, and defines the ViewHolder.
- **viewmodel**
  - `MainActivityViewModel.java`: Extends `AndroidViewModel`, uses `MovieRepository` to fetch movie data, and provides LiveData for the view.
- **MainActivity.java**: The main activity that sets up the ViewModel, RecyclerView, and handles UI interactions.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skwasimrazzak/movie-app.git

Currently, I am a front-end developer. Soon to be a full-stack developer as I learn something new every day. Love coding and uploaded some basic websites (initially created by me) to track my improvement through out the process of learning. I have a rudimentary understanding of C and Python programming.Very enthusiastic about collaboration. Creating a team of like-minded people and working with them to build a project is something I often do and like to do so. Having a constant urge to learn made me do whatever I did to date.
